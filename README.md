# MakerSafe

Every year, thousands of eager tinkerers and enthusiasts enter makerspaces to gain access to powerful tools and machinery. Unfortunately, these tools are as dangerous as they are powerful, so it is imperative safety standards are respected in order to maintain a safe makerspace. Additionally, time is often of the essence for tinkerers on a project deadline, so we sought to create a informative and safety-first dashboard and monitoring system for makerspaces.
